This folder contains every results from our experiences. Currently, we only have experiences on standard dataset. 

In the `Figures` folder, we find every figure comparing our results on the 150 instances to Coelho's and deterministic's results (we got those by applying the _HGS-DSIRP_ with one scenario, true demand on this one and by limiting inventories at the end of the day only).

In others, we find all the results with related solutions. The `irp_results.txt` contain every results (but not with the solutions) and computational time with related instances. The `coelho_results.txt` contain the same thing but with coelho results (only costs, not computational times), sorted in the same order than the previous one. Finally, the `dsirpr_results` folder contains every solution and related costs for _HGS-DSIRP_ with end day inventory limitation while the `dsirp_results` folder contains every solution and related costs for _HGS-DSIRP_ with starting day inventory limitation. For each file in those we have: for each day, the solution (tour and delivered quantities) and every costs. The final _total cost_ at the end of the file in the global cost at the end of resolution.
